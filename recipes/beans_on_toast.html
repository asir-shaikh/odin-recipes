    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> 
        The creation of  “beans on toast” was a marketing event by the Heinz company in 1927, 
        and fared well during WWII. Surprisingly, 
        Heinz Beans were first produced in Pittsburgh, 
        Pennsylvania in 1895, and were exported to the UK beginning in 1904, 
        albeit at a high price point. However, 
        it was not until 1928 that Heinz began producing baked beans at their factory located just 
        outside London that the popularity increased in the UK due to the lower price.

    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>1 tin 13.7 oz (390 g) of Heinz beans (made in England)</li>
        <li>3 slices of bread</li>
        <li>(pat of butter is optional)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Put the beans into a small pot over medium low heat.</li>
        <li>Put the bread in the toaster, and make the toast as desired. (If you like, you can butter the toast, but I find it unecessary as the beans are the primary flavor.)</li>
        <li>Stir the beans, and heat until almost boiling, but don't allow to boil. (According to directions on the tin, this will affect the flavor.)</li>
        <li>Place the toast on plates, and spoon ⅓ tin of the beans over the top of each slice. Serve immediately, preferably with a cup of hot tea.</li>
    </ul>
