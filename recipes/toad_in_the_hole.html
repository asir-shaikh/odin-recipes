    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Toad in the hole or sausage toad is a traditional English[1][2] dish consisting of sausages in Yorkshire pudding batter, 
        usually served with onion gravy and vegetables.[3] Historically, 
        the dish has also been prepared using other meats, such as rump steak and lamb's kidney.

    <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>sunflower oil</li>
        <li>8 higher-welfare sausages</li>
        <li>4 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 large red onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 knobs of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li> 1 level tablespoon vegetable stock powder or 1 organic vegetable stock cube</li>
        <li>285 ml milk</li>
        <li>115 g plain flour</li>
        <li>3 large free-range eggs</li>
    </ol>

    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Whisk the batter ingredients together with a pinch of sea salt, and put to one side. I like the batter to go huge so the key thing is to have an appropriately-sized baking tin , the thinner the better as we need to get the oil smoking hot.</li>
        <li>Put 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil into a baking tin, then place on the middle shelf of your oven at its highest setting (240 to 250ºC/475ºF/gas 9). Place a larger tray underneath it to catch any oil that overflows from the tin while cooking.</li>
        <li> When the oil is very hot, add the sausages  keep an eye on them and allow them to colour until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>At this point, take the tin out of the oven, being very careful, and pour the batter over the sausages. Throw a couple of sprigs of rosemary into the batter.</li>
        <li>It will bubble and possibly even spit a little, so carefully put the tin back in the oven, and close the door. Don't open it for at least 20 minutes, as Yorkshire puddings can be a bit temperamental when rising. Remove from the oven when golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>For the onion gravy, peel and finely slice the onions and garlic, then simply fry off in the butter on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until they go sweet and translucent. You could add a little thyme or rosemary here, if you like. Add the balsamic vinegar and allow it to cook down by half.</li>
        <li>At this point, I do cheat a little and add a stock cube or powder. You can get some good ones in the supermarkets now that aren't full of rubbish. Sprinkle this in and add a little water. Allow to simmer and you'll have a really tasty onion gravy.</li>
        <li>Serve at the table with the Toad in the hole, mashed potatoes, greens and baked beans or maybe a green salad if you're feeling a little guilty!</li>
